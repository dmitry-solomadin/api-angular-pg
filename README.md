### Install && Run

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
